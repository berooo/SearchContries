For this project we'll be reading in a tab delimited file. The file will be information about countries around the 
globe. Then we'll be processing a series of commands about the file. On each command you'll be reading the file 
that was given by the command file. You won't be storing the file information in any sort of structure between 
commands, i.e. no using arrays, vectors, lists, etc
